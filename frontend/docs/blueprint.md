# **App Name**: WaterWise

## Core Features:

- Field Mapping: Allow farmers to map out their fields using coordinates and specify crop type, growth stage, and irrigation system efficiency.
- Hydration Dashboard: Provide a real-time snapshot of farm conditions including crop distribution, soil moisture levels, precipitation, and wind speed. Visually represent field hydration status on an interactive map.
- Irrigation Schedule Generation: Calculate and display a proposed irrigation schedule for the next 7 days, detailing water requirements and optimal irrigation times. Calculations are based on evapotranspiration data, precipitation data, and crop coefficients.
- Water Usage Calculation: Calculate water usage based on field area, crop coefficient, evapotranspiration, and precipitation data using the Shoelace theorem and trigonometric identities to account for the Earth's curvature.
- Sprout AI Chatbot: An AI chatbot to answer farmers' questions about their farm and provide personalized insights, acting as a helpful tool for decision-making.
- Hydration Job Tracking: Enable farmers to track hydration jobs, highlighting completed, active, and pending tasks to prioritize irrigation efforts.
